This script enhances your FiveM server experience by introducing interactive mechanics for player management. Seamlessly integrated with ESX, it allows you to detect nearby players, open menus for fingerprint checks or document creation, and manage player actions within a specified area. The script displays markers for interaction points, provides options for player verification or document creation, and notifies you of the success or failure of these actions. With built-in support for querying nearby players and a user-friendly menu system, it boosts interactivity and server management.
